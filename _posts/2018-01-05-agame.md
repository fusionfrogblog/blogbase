My kids are spending more time playing games on the tablet. One of them is Geometry Dash.
I wanted to demonstrate that making a simple game is not that hard.  Additionally they can be
involved in creating additional levels. So, with some Javascript and bit of tweaking here is what we came up with.

[The impossible game](/agame/).

```yaml
Javascript: this.play();

```

![transparent red overlay]({{ "/assets/images/3953273590_704e3899d5_m.jpg"  }})

```yaml
excerpt: "More to come.."
```
