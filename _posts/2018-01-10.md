The brain is able to construct real words in phrases even if absurd.  They reflect your view and experiences. From that experience I like to dispatch the following.  My present view of self. I in the sea of many, swimming along with others, I perceive the world with a different lens.  That is of course, only my perception based on responses to my vocal ramblings. Hence it is my goal to capture my thoughts in writing so that perhaps others might relate.

The time is 8pm and location is Seattle. This is too simplistic since it assumes a reference of human made measurement. More accurate would be starting with a universal reference like pulsar that does not rely on prior human culture to exist. Yes, I often think this way. This is the prequel of what I will be discussing. We often only look at the word through our individual perception and often forget that we are not alone, that said this goes beyond humanity.
