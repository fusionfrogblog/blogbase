My kids are spending too much time playing games on their iPad and don't get an appreciation for what is really happening inside their little black boxes.
To stir their little curious minds, I set out to demonstrate that being part of making a game can be as fun.  With a bit of Javascript and some creative help from my kids here is what we came up with. [Unicorn vs Poop](/uvp/).
