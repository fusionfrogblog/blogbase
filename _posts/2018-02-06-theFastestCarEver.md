Today was another spectacular display of human achievement. SpaceX made history and put a car into space making it the fastest car in history on its Falcon Heavy rocket. What is more spectacular is we once again have a rocket that can lift 140,700 lb (63,800 kg) or the weight of two whales into space.  A future use of this type of rocket could also be used to transport people around the planet under 30 minutes.  This is not the biggest rocket, [Saturn V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_orbital_launch_systems) still has that title but this rocket far more economical and reusable.

Inside the car sits 'Starman' that is speeding away towards Mars and the asteroid belt.
