Today was another spectacular display of human achievement. SpaceX made history and put a car into space making it the fastest car in history on its Falcon Heavy rocket. What is more spectacular is we once again have a rocket that can lift 140,700 lbs (63,800 kg) or the weight of two whales into space. ![Whale](/assets/images/posts/spacewhale.jpg){: .align-left}  This is not the biggest rocket, [Saturn V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_orbital_launch_systems) still has that title but this rocket far more economical and reusable.
Many fail to see the significance of this type of achievement and some even see it as a arrogance of the [few](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_Billionaires) to do what ever they please. While some of these concerns are valid, the advances in technology could benefit all. A possible future use of this type of rocket could be used to transport people around the planet under [30 minutes](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2017/sep/29/long-distance-flights-in-30-minutes-elon-musk-video). An existing example is GPS, a space born technology that began after the very first space launch of [Sputnik](http://gpsworld.com/origins-gps-part-1/).
Lots of people find exploration and development of new technologies exciting. The large missing element is considering who it will benefit. What is needed is to create a requirement into the initial design that the technology will grow in benefit to as many people as possible. Space is [large](http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html) and resources [plenty](http://www.asterank.com/). The missing part is the technology and who will be able use it.
